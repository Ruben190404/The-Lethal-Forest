#Lore <br>
Once upon a time, there was a mischievous frog named Freddy. 
Freddy lived near a monster fruit store owned by a fierce monster named Grondor. 
Despite Grondor's fearsome reputation, he had grown tired of constantly killing and decided to open a fruit store as a change of pace.

One day, Freddy stumbled upon Grondor's store and couldn't resist the temptation of the plump, juicy cherries. 
So, he snuck in and stole as many cherries as he could carry.

However, as Freddy was hopping away with his stolen loot, he was suddenly ambushed by Grondor who had caught wind of the theft. 
Freddy panicked and fled into the nearby forest, dropping the cherries as he ran.

Grondor, furious at the loss of his cherries, set out to hunt down Freddy and kill him for his theft. 
Freddy, aware of Grondor's pursuit, did his best to hide and evade the monster.

Days turned into weeks and Grondor's search for Freddy became relentless. 
Freddy was on the run, constantly dodging Grondor's attempts to capture him. 
But eventually, Grondor's persistence paid off, and he cornered Freddy in a clearing in the forest.

Just as Grondor was about to strike, Freddy suddenly remembered the cherries he had dropped. 
In a desperate attempt to save himself, Freddy pointed out the cherries and offered to retrieve them for Grondor. 
Grondor, surprised by Freddy's willingness to make amends, agreed.

As Freddy collected the cherries, he noticed that Grondor's guard was down. 
In that moment, Freddy saw an opportunity to take out Grondor and end his pursuit once and for all. 
With lightning speed, Freddy ran to a shotgun that dropped out of the sky and shot Grondor, killing him in the process.

Freddy collected the cherries and made his escape, free from Grondor's wrath. 
He lived out the rest of his days in peace, knowing that his actions had saved him from a fate worse than death.

But then...
